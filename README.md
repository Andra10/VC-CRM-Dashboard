## The Problem We Tackled

Venture capitalists face a critical inefficiency that costs them both time and opportunities: cognitive overload from scattered information across fragmented channels.
_The Core Challenge:_

-   _Scattered Information Problem:_ Critical startup data lives in silos across WhatsApp, LinkedIn Messages, Slack, Discord, emails, Crunchbase, AngelList, and Product Hunt
-   _Cognitive Flow Disruption:_ Constant context switching between 6-8 different platforms fragments mental focus and decision-making capacity
-   _Information Synthesis Overhead:_ VCs spend 60-70% of their time manually aggregating data rather than analyzing opportunities
-   _Signal-to-Noise Crisis:_ 90% of opportunities are eliminated at deal sourcing, but buried signals mean high-potential deals get missed
-   _Mental Load Accumulation:_ Managing multiple information streams simultaneously creates decision fatigue and reduces screening quality
-   _No Unified Context:_ Lack of consolidated view prevents pattern recognition and comprehensive opportunity assessment

_User Story:_ As an investor, John VC wants to simplify the management of his investment portfolio by reducing the time spent on monitoring multiple channels, minimizing cognitive load from constant context switching, and streamlining the inflow of new investment opportunitiesâ€”so he can focus on making smarter, faster investment decisions.

## How It Works

_Multi-Channel Data Ingestion_

We continuously monitor the communication platforms you use (Whatsapp, Slack, LinkedIn, email) to extract startup mentions, highly relevant investment inquiries and we enrich that data with business intelligence from Crunchbase, AngelList, Product Hunt and our own data base, so Matcha AI can give you actionable notifications and reports of your comms.

_Applies VC-style screening criteria (market size, team pedigree, traction metrics)_

We score opportunities based on 10x ROI potential or more. We detect the red flags in the different stages of the funnel (inconsistencies, market risks, team issues...) and green flags based on the profile of the founders, what metrics and objectives they tell us, how they communicate and the overall market landscape and positioning. We deliver these highly relevant notifications right into your inbox!

## Framework

VCs' main task is to distinguish which of the startup leads they receive are good candidates for a ROI > x10. We want to model this as a funnel, where at every step, some candidates are discarded.

A possible funnel is the following one:

1. Deal Sourcing (90% of opportunities eliminated here)
   Warm introductions from portfolio companies/other VCs
   Pattern recognition from sector specialists
   Inbound from accelerators/previous investments
   Cold outreach (sub-1% conversion)
2. Initial Screen (quick, a few minutes at most)
   Market size and timing
   Team pedigree and founder-market fit
   Traction metrics vs. stage expectations
   Investment thesis alignment
3. Deep Dive (2-3 weeks)
   Competitive landscape analysis
   Customer reference calls
   Financial model stress-testing
   Technical/product due diligence
4. Partner Presentation (The "pitch" - only 10% of qualified deals)
   Risk mitigation story
   10x return potential demonstration
   Exit strategy clarity
5. Final Due Diligence (Legal, technical, financial)

We want to enable VCs to understand when they need to prioritize a lead (or skip devouting more hours on one...) so they can move quickly in their own process when other VCs haven't even heard the starting shot.
